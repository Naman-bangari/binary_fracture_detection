# Binary Fracture Classification

## Fracture Detection and Its Benefits

Fracture detection refers to the process of identifying breaks or cracks in bones through medical imaging techniques like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs. Early detection of fractures is crucial because it allows for timely and appropriate medical intervention, which can lead to:

- **Better Healing**: Prompt treatment can enhance the healing process.
- **Reduced Risk of Complications**: Minimizes the likelihood of complications associated with untreated fractures.
- **Improved Patient Outcomes**: Ensures overall better health and recovery.
- **Minimized Pain and Disability**: Prevents the progression of the injury, reducing pain and long-term disability.
- **Cost-Effective**: Avoids more invasive and expensive treatments by addressing the issue early.

## VGG19 Model for Fracture Detection

**VGG19** is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model known for its deep architecture, consisting of 19 layers, including convolutional and fully connected layers. In the context of fracture detection, VGG19 can be trained to identify fractures in medical images by learning to recognize patterns associated with fractures.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

When evaluating the performance of a classification model like VGG19 for fracture detection, several metrics are used:

- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. It indicates how many of the predicted positive cases are actually positive.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. It indicates how many of the actual positive cases were correctly predicted.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall.
- **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the dataset.
